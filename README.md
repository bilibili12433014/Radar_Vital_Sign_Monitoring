# mmWave Radar-based Personalized Multi-object Vital Signs Monitoring

Millimeter-wave radar based on Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) has emerged as a promising technology for vital signs monitoring, owing to its high spatial resolution and non-contact measurement capability. Despite this, most prior research has primarily concentrated on improving detection accuracy for either multiple stationary subjects or a single moving subject. In this paper, we propose a personalized monitoring framework capable of handling multiple individuals in dynamic scenarios. Our approach can adaptively differentiate between motion and steady states, ensuring reliable monitoring performance even when subjects are not completely still. Specifically, we introduce a weight vector optimization mechanism integrated with spatial positioning to achieve multi-object separation, and employ a gait recognition model built upon EfficientNet to establish individual identity. In addition, a steady-state identification module, constructed using the MobileNet-V2 network, is designed to detect intervals when subjects remain motionless. During these periods, we apply the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) technique to accurately extract respiratory and cardiac signals from each person.
